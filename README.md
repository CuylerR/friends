# friends by Cuyler Reynolds

#OVERVIEW
#friends is a project built with react native that allows you to visually see the location of yourself as well as a friend.
#While this seems like a relatively simple idea, I added small but intricate features, such as not being able to get a ride until you put it an address.
#Another feature is seeing the pins on the map visually displayed and this works for anywhere in the world.
